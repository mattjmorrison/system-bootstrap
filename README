This is a bootstrap script to setup a new virtual machine linux (debian/ubuntu) machine,
and/or build server(s) for python projects.

Use this in conjunction with Buildout to get a project up and running.

To use this run the following command:
wget --no-check-certificate http://github.com/mattjmorrison/python-linux-bootstrap/raw/master//bootstrap && source bootstrap

Note: you may or may not need the --no-check-certificate depending on the version of wget you're using
